# Huawei

The final step towards my graduation, Huawei was my first "real" job experience. Laurent DAUÃ‡A opened the door for me, Eric broke me in. 

Under [Shen Ning](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-shen-b9146b78/) (Eric) we worked tirelesly in the department of Intelligent Computing to deliver client succes, despite a tough macro-environement.
